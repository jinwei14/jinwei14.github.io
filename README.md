8 tiny app ideas
Without further ado, here is the list:

1. Dictionary app
For simplicity, keep all the words in memory. You can find a dictionary .json file at adambom/dictionary.

2. Grocery list app
Basically like a TODO list app, but you don’t need the option of checking off each item since you’ll buy everything at once. From there you could add support for item quantities, or a feature to save past lists. Use localStorage to avoid needing a server.

3. Personal budget tool
Download your transactions from your bank (probably as CSV) and convert them to JSON. Then write an app that lets you search/sort/filter them.

4. Tic tac toe game
Simple games make great first apps. Don’t worry about networking - just make it so both players play from the same computer.

5. Basic calendar app
Build an app that allows you to browse the calendar. Add dates that you find interesting - celebrity birthdays, foreign holidays, or whatever.

6. Image gallery app
Make an app that displays pictures of family members or chronicles a recent vacation. This one is great practice - so many sites have image galleries (e.g. Yelp, Facebook, Pinterest).

7. Recipe search app
Type up your recipes into JSON format, then build an app that allows you to search them. For extra credit, make it so you can enter what ingredients you have and it will show you which recipes you can make.

8. Hangman game
If you’re not familiar with Hangman - it’s a game where the players try to guess a word. If you use a random word from the dictionary then you won't know the word and you can play by yourself.
